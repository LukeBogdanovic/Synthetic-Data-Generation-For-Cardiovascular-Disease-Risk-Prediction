## Generative Adversarial Networks for Electrocardiogram Generation

A pair of generative adversarial networks (GANs) are provided in this repository. The first of these models is a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) that uses gradient penalty (gp) and dynamic time warping (dtw) to generate 5 second segments of ECG data
